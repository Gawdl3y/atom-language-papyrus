# language-papyrus package for Atom

Adds support for the Papyrus language and its assembly to Atom.

Papyrus is a scripting language for the Creation Engine, the game engine that *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* and *Fallout 4* run on.
Mods for Skyrim and Fallout 4 use this language to make things happen in the game.

Check out the Papyrus reference for [Skyrim](http://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Category:Papyrus) or [Fallout 4](http://www.creationkit.com/fallout4/index.php?title=Category:Papyrus).

Grammars and snippets for Skyrim are based on [SublimePapyrus](https://github.com/Kapiainen/SublimePapyrus), converted for Atom and modified.
